# QuizPad
Quiz creating software

This program was created with an intention to provide random generation of quizes based on an already 
created question database stored locally on the computer.


Currently QuizPAD generates randomly only if the database file follows a certain format:  
1)The questions should be numbered using the numbering tool within the program.  
2)Only .rtf files are supported as of now.  

**Features of QuizPAD:**  
1)Unique ability to randomly switch questions as well as their options (in cases of objective type quizes).
Check out the sample under comptersci>optiontest>level0>singleanswer for more info.  
2)Since the files are stored locally, the possibility of hacking onto a question bank is zero.

**Features to be added:**  
1).doc/.docx support.  
2)remote hosting of database with encryption  
3)dynamic locations as database (Currently only at Root_Folder/Databases/ )
